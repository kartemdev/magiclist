<h1>Magic List</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
The MagicList demo project implies a product for business. At this point in time, the structure, authorization, and methodologies and technologies have been implemented. The project is not forgotten and you can already see what skills I have.
The main motivation for writing this project is to rewrite the <a href="https://github.com/kartemdev/TaskWelbeX" target="_blank">TaskWelbex</a> project with further scaling and implementation of business tools.
<h3>Local startup</h3>
This project has been hosted before, to explore this topic. Since there is no basic functionality yet, I stopped hosting it. 
So you can start it in dev mode, via npm start. But for correct authorization and viewing of available functionality you should install and run <a href="https://github.com/kartemdev/magiclis-api" target="_blank">magiclis-api</a> backend locally.
<h3>Structure and technologies</h3>
Technologies I used: <i>React, TypeScript, RTK-Query, React Router Dom, Webpack, React Hook Form, I18Next, Yup</i> and some more, which you can see in <a href="https://github.com/kartemdev/magiclist/blob/master/client/package.json">package.json</a>. For hosting I used: <i>Docker and Nginx</i>.
I also used some rules from FSD, organizing my project structure as a mixture of Modular Architecture and FSD. Just below look at some representation of the dependency direction of the so called application layers, the arrows indicate the dependencies (what a layer can use).
